# 🌱 Grass Karma – The App That Helps Neighbours Mow Smarter, Together

**Grass Karma** is a community-first startup reinventing how Australian neighbours care for nature strips.
No nagging. No confusion. **Just streamlined teamwork or shared hiring — with zero friction.**

Our mission is to **make streets greener and friendlier** by helping neighbours organise mowing rosters or pool funds for pros, all in one clean, transparent platform.

We believe tidy lawns should build community, not tension.

# 🚜 What Makes Grass Karma Special?

✅ **Street-based groups** – auto-detects your address, so you're always in the right group
✅ **Two modes** – choose a rotating DIY roster or hire a pro as a team
✅ **Fairness built-in** – track turns, request swaps, or contribute money if you’re unavailable
✅ **Effortless reminders** – no more awkward texts or “sorry, forgot!” messages
✅ **Invoice splitting** – automatic payments if hiring a local pro
✅ **Flexible and friendly** – switch plans any time based on life changes

We believe in:
**Friendly lawns, not forgotten ones.**
**Good vibes, not guilt trips.**
**Shared effort, shared rewards.**

# 🌼 About the Product

Grass Karma is a **web app for neighbour collaboration** — helping each street group decide how they want to keep their nature strips trim and tidy.

Whether you’re hands-on with your mower or prefer to chip in for a professional, the app keeps everything organised, fair, and simple.

### ✂️ Two Modes to Choose From:

**1. Roster Mode (DIY):**
Take turns mowing. The app auto-generates a fair schedule, sends reminders, and lets people swap dates with one tap.

**2. Pooling Mode (Hire a Pro):**
Neighbours vote to chip in and get a landscaper. Bulk mowing = lower cost. Grass Karma finds the pro, splits the invoice, and manages the whole process.
